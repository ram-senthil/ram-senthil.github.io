My name is Ramakrishna Senthil but I go by 'Ram'! I just graduated from USC with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in Computer programming. I am currently studying for my M.S. in Aerospace Engineering with an emphasis on Fluids & Structures. 

I made this webpage to showcase my engineering work at USC Racing as well as academic & personal projects in a blog format. Additionally, I've included a photography tab to highlight my recent shots. 

P.S.: [Here](https://ramakrishnasenthil.github.io) is the first webpage I made ever.
