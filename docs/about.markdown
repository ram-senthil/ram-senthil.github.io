My name is Ramakrishna Senthil but I go by 'Ram'! I just graduated from USC with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in Computer programming. I am currently studying for my M.S. in Aerospace Engineering with an emphasis on Fluids & Structures. 

I made this webpage to showcase my engineering work at USC Racing as well as academic & personal projects.

P.S.: [Here](https://ramakrishnasenthil.github.io) is the first webpage I made ever. I made it as a 16 y.o. in my AP Computer Science Principles course in High School.
