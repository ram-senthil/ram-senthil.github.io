I want to design and build an R/C plane from scratch. My first stab at R/C planes was back in 2019. The post describing that is [here](https://ram-senthil.github.io/personal/2019/12/15/rc-plane.html)


To successfully design an R/C plane, I decided to start with the instrumentation required to measure key performance parameters. One of the most important parameters to be aware of in aircraft design is a thrust curve. This will allow me to refine my design by assuming the only available system I have is the one I currently own. ~insert specs of the motor and propeller blade~

To measure a thrust curve, I will need to create a device which measures thrust and is able to modulate the inputted voltage. This article describes my process through it all.
