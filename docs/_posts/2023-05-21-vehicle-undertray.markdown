I am currently the Aerodynamics Lead Engineer of USC Racing, my school's Formula Student team. As the Lead Aerodynamics Engineer, I am responsible for the design, analysis, manufacturing, and validation of the vehicle’s aerodynamics package. In this post, I describe the design cycle for the development of the team’s first successful undertray in which I had direct and immense involvement throughout. This work was conducted between Aug 2022-May 2023 with the competition May 17-21, 2023 at Michigan. We placed 3rd/120 teams at design finals in the Aerodynamics category.

A vehicle undertray is used to improve track performance of a racecar. This is accomplished by downforce to increase the amount of load on the tires providing more grip.
