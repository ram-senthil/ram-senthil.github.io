As a preface, I built this plane using the following youtube video. I had no part in the design of it.

Here are the results:

I managed to get it flying but it was very unstable. Additionally, due to the low C_L, to keep it aloft required a significant amount of speed which as an amateur R/C pilot was not able to control. It quickly came to its demise after about a minute aloft.

Here is it crashed into a tree:

Here is the wreckage:
