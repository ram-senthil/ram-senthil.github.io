description: My first try at making an R/C Plane from scratch

As a preface, I built this plane using the following youtube video. I had no part in the design of it.

Here are some pictures along the way

I managed to get it flying but it was very unstable. Additionally, due to the low C~L~, to keep it aloft required a significant amount of speed which as an amateur R/C pilot was not able to control. It quickly came to its demise after about a minute aloft.
